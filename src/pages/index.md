      I'm Aisha, a fun-loving Digital Content Marketer.


      I believe the art of storytelling is a magical tool, so I leverage it to help brands gain and sustain a profitable presence online. 


      In my 4+ years of experience sharing the good-news that is my work with agencies and businesses across various industries worldwide, I've had the opportunity to create magic with a number of remarkable brands. Some of them are: Webcoupers, Of A Kind Creatives (USA), Carbon (Paylater), She Leads Africa, and CK Digital. 


      When I'm not brainstorming ideas for the next great piece of content, you'll catch me diving into my passions which are: tech, diversity & inclusion, gender equality, youth empowerment, personal development, leadership & volunteering.
