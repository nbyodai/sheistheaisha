      Hi! My name is Aisha Owolabi, and welcome to my website. 


      I’m a digital content marketer with 3+ years of experience working with
      agencies and businesses across various industries worldwide. I'm skilful
      in using storytelling primarily to improve brand positioning and help
      brands gain and sustain a profitable presence online.


      I’ve created content in the past and currently for brands like Webcoupers,
      Of A Kind Creatives (USA), Carbon, She Leads Africa, and CK Digital. 


      I am passionate about tech, diversity & inclusion, gender equality, youth
      empowerment, personal development, leadership & volunteering
