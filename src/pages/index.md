      ![Aisha Owolabi](/images/sheistheaisha.png "sheistheaisha")


      I’m Aisha, a fun-loving content marketer, storyteller & branding enthusiast. 


      I help brands break down complex ideas into simple content pieces that are easily digestible and solves real problems.


      My ideal process is “Agile Content Process” which encompasses research, content strategy, data analysis and iteration. 


      In my 4+ years of experience, I've created magic with several remarkable brands. Some of them are: [Webcoupers](www.webcoupers.com), [Carbon](www.getcarbon.co), [Of A Kind Creatives](www.ofakindcreatives.com) (USA), [She Leads Africa](www.sheleadsafrica.org) and [CK Digital](www.ckdigital.net).


      I am passionate about diversity & inclusion, gender equality, and women empowerment & I enjoy sharing my thoughts via social media and talks.
